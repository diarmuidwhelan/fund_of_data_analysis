### An analysis of Anscombe's quartet dataset
The Fundamentals_of_analysis.ipynb file contains an examination of the Anscombe's quartet package. The file is a python jupyter notebook, which is an interactive python file. If there are any issues with the file you should start from the top and run the code cell by cell. The file aims to cover the following points:
1. Explain the background to the dataset â€“ who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.
2. Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.
3. Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.
4. Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics above.
