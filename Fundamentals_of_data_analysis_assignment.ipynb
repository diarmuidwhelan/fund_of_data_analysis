(X3,Y3) appears to be perfectly linear apart from one datapoint which is a massive outlier. Finally, (X4,Y4) is a vertical line aside from a solitary outlier. Each pair have quite distinctive plots. Using the seaborn package, we can further visualise the different pairs. Each plot is overlayed with the line of best fit is printed along with the 95% confidence interval."
